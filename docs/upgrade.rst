Upgrade
=======

Upgrading from Cheese Shop
--------------------------

.. note::
   Firstly, it is recommended that you **always** perform a database backup before doing an upgrade.

The easiest way to upgrade ``rhodecode`` is to run::

 easy_install -U rhodecode

Or::

 pip install --upgrade rhodecode


Then make sure you run the following command from the installation directory::
 
 paster make-config RhodeCode production.ini
 
This will display any changes made by the new version of RhodeCode to your
current configuration. It will try to perform an automerge. It's always better
to make a backup of your configuration file before hand and recheck the content after the automerge.

.. note::
   The next steps only apply to upgrading from non bugfix releases eg. from
   any minor or major releases. Bugfix releases (eg. 1.1.2->1.1.3) will 
   not have any database schema changes or whoosh library updates.

It is also recommended that you rebuild the whoosh index after upgrading since the new whoosh 
version could introduce some incompatible index changes.


The final step is to upgrade the database. To do this simply run::

    paster upgrade-db production.ini
 
This will upgrade the schema and update some of the defaults in the database,
and will always recheck the settings of the application, if there are no new options
that need to be set.
