Contributing in RhodeCode
=========================

If You would like to contribute to RhodeCode, please contact me, any help is
greatly appreciated.

Preferable method Would be to fork RhodeCode repository from bitbucket
https://bitbucket.org/marcinkuzminski/rhodecode and then open a pull request.
This way it's easier for me to merge.

To run RhodeCode in a development version You always need to install tip
version of RhodeCode and VCS library.


Thank You.
