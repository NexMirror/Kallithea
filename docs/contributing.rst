Contributing to RhodeCode
=========================

If you would like to contribute to RhodeCode, please contact me, any help is
greatly appreciated!

Could I request that you make your source contributions by first forking the
RhodeCode repository on bitbucket
https://bitbucket.org/marcinkuzminski/rhodecode and then make your changes to
your forked repository. Finally, when you are finished making a change, please
send me a pull request.

To run RhodeCode in a development version you always need to install the tip
version of RhodeCode and the VCS library.

| Thank you for any contributions!
