Installation
============

``RhodeCode`` is written entirely in Python. Before posting any issues make 
sure, your not missing any system libraries and using right version of 
libraries required by RhodeCode. There's also restriction in terms of mercurial
clients. Minimal version of hg client known working fine with RhodeCode is
**1.6**. If you're using older client, please upgrade.


Installing RhodeCode from Cheese Shop
-------------------------------------

Rhodecode requires python version 2.5 or higher.

The easiest way to install ``rhodecode`` is to run::

    easy_install rhodecode

Or::

    pip install rhodecode

If you prefer to install RhodeCode manually simply grab latest release from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RhodeCode, decompress the archive and run::

    python setup.py install

Step by step installation example for Linux
-------------------------------------------


For installing RhodeCode i highly recommend using separate virtualenv_. This
way many required by RhodeCode libraries will remain sandboxed from your main
python and making things less problematic when doing system python updates. 

- Assuming you have installed virtualenv_ create a new virtual environment 
  using virtualenv command:: 

    virtualenv --no-site-packages /var/www/rhodecode-venv


.. note:: Using ``--no-site-packages`` when generating your
   virtualenv is **very important**. This flag provides the necessary
   isolation for running the set of packages required by
   RhodeCode.  If you do not specify ``--no-site-packages``,
   it's possible that RhodeCode will not install properly into
   the virtualenv, or, even if it does, may not run properly,
   depending on the packages you've already got installed into your
   Python's "main" site-packages dir.


- this will install new virtualenv_ into `/var/www/rhodecode-venv`. 
- Activate the virtualenv_ by running::

    source /var/www/rhodecode-venv/bin/activate

.. note:: If you're using UNIX, *do not* use ``sudo`` to run the
   ``virtualenv`` script.  It's perfectly acceptable (and desirable)
   to create a virtualenv as a normal user.
     
- Make a folder for rhodecode data files, and configuration somewhere on the 
  filesystem. For example::

    mkdir /var/www/rhodecode
  
    
- Go into the created directory run this command to install rhodecode::

    easy_install rhodecode
  
  or::
 
    pip install rhodecode 

- This will install rhodecode together with pylons and all other required 
  python libraries into activated virtualenv

Requirements for Celery (optional)
----------------------------------

In order to gain maximum performance
there are some third-party you must install. When RhodeCode is used 
together with celery you have to install some kind of message broker,
recommended one is rabbitmq_ to make the async tasks work.

Of course RhodeCode works in sync mode also and then you do not have to install
any third party applications. However, using Celery_ will give you a large 
speed improvement when using many big repositories. If you plan to use 
RhodeCode for say 7 to 10 repositories, RhodeCode will perform perfectly well 
without celery running.
   
If you make the decision to run RhodeCode with celery make sure you run 
celeryd using paster and message broker together with the application. 

.. note::
   Installing message broker and using celery is optional, RhodeCode will
   work perfectly fine without them.


**Message Broker** 

- preferred is `RabbitMq <http://www.rabbitmq.com/>`_
- A possible alternative is `Redis <http://code.google.com/p/redis/>`_

This is a very nice tutorial on how to start using celery_ with rabbitmq_


You can now proceed to :ref:`setup`
